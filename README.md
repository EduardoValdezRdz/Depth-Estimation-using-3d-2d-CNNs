# Depth-Estimation-using-3d-2d-CNNs
In this work, we propose a hybrid 3D-2D CNN capable of estimating depth from a single image. The 2D CNN carries out the semantic segmentation and the 3D CNN estimates depth from it and the RGB image. The semantic segmentation CNN receives as input the RGB image and the output is the semantic segmentation. The depth estimation CNN receives as input the semantic segmentation and the RGB image, ad the output is the estimated grayscale depth. To use the hybrid CNN first you need to train the semantic segmentation and depth estimation separately once trained load both weights in the SSEGDEPTH-NET, and test the images.
